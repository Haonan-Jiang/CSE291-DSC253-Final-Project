      "2. **Identify key terms and concepts**: Extract relevant keywords, phrases, and ideas from the title, abstract, and introduction.\n",
      "3. **Analyze conceptual connections**: Examine how these key terms and concepts relate to each other and to broader research fields.\n",
      "4. **Look for patterns and trends**: Identify patterns, such as the combination of machine learning and finance, that may indicate a specific field or subfield.\n",
      "5. **Consider the paper's focus and methodology**: Analyze the paper's objectives, methods, and results to determine whether it is focused on computational modeling, statistical analysis, experimental design, or theoretical development.\n",
      "6. **Consult relevant labels and categories**: Draw from existing classification systems (e.g., ACM Computing Classification System, Journal of Physics: Conference Series) to inform your classification.\n",
      "7. **Be cautious with ambiguous titles**: Some papers may have misleading or unclear titles, so be prepared to re-evaluate the paper's content and concepts if necessary.\n",
      "8. **Use a combination of features**: Don't rely solely on one aspect; consider multiple factors (e.g., title, abstract, introduction, methodology) when making your classification decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these guidelines and reflecting on my thought process, you can develop a systematic approach to accurately classifying research papers into their respective fields.\n",
