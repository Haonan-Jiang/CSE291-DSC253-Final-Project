      "Analysis of Samples:\n",
      "Based on the provided samples, I will derive general principles for classifying news articles into categories 'World', 'Sports', 'Business', or 'Sci/Tech'.\n",
      "\n",
      "**General Principles:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **'World' Category:** Typically defined by global implications, international events, and topics that transcend geographical boundaries.\n",
      "\t* Characteristics: Global scope, international involvement, significant impact on multiple regions or countries.\n",
      "\t* Common mistakes to avoid:\n",
      "\t\t+ Misclassifying 'Sports' news with international teams or players as 'World'.\n",
      "\t\t+ Classifying regional or local issues as 'World' without global implications.\n",
      "2. **'Sports' Category:** Typically defined by competitions, teams, athletes, and events that are primarily focused on sports and recreation.\n",
      "\t* Characteristics: Focus on specific sports, teams, or athletes; competitions, tournaments, and leagues.\n",
      "\t* Common mistakes to avoid:\n",
      "\t\t+ Misclassifying 'World' news with international implications as 'Sports'.\n",
      "\t\t+ Classifying non-competitive sporting activities (e.g., charity runs) as 'Sports'.\n",
      "3. **'Business' Category:** Typically defined by economic trends, financial transactions, market fluctuations, and company news that are primarily focused on commerce and industry.\n",
      "\t* Characteristics: Focus on business operations, finance, trade, and market performance; mergers, acquisitions, and IPOs.\n",
      "\t* Common mistakes to avoid:\n",
      "\t\t+ Misclassifying 'World' news with global economic implications as 'Business'.\n",
      "\t\t+ Classifying non-business-related topics (e.g., sports sponsorships) as 'Business'.\n",
      "4. **'Sci/Tech' Category:** Typically defined by scientific discoveries, technological advancements, and innovative developments that are primarily focused on research, development, and innovation.\n",
      "\t* Characteristics: Focus on scientific breakthroughs, technological innovations, and research findings; new products, services, or processes.\n",
      "\t* Common mistakes to avoid:\n",
      "\t\t+ Misclassifying 'World' news with global implications for scientific or technological advancements as 'Sci/Tech'.\n",
      "\t\t+ Classifying non-scientific or technological topics (e.g., environmental issues) as 'Sci/Tech'.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Guidelines:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Read the headline:** Pay attention to the main topic and keywords in the title.\n",
      "2. **Identify the focus:** Determine whether the article is primarily focused on a specific sport, team, athlete, event, or global implications.\n",
      "3. **Analyze the content:** Assess the tone, language, and style of the writing. Is it formal and informative (e.g., scientific report) or casual and promotional (e.g., sports news)?\n",
      "4. **Consider the context:** Think about the broader implications and potential impact on multiple regions or countries.\n",
      "5. **Verify your classification:** Double-check that you haven't misclassified the article based on common mistakes to avoid.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these general principles, guidelines, and warnings, you can accurately predict the category of a news article without additional context.\n",
      "Optimized Prompt:\n",
      "Classify a news article as 'World', 'Sports', 'Business', or 'Sci/Tech' based on its content, considering the following criteria:\n",
      "\n",
      "* For 'World': Global implications, international events, and topics transcending geographical boundaries.\n",

      "\t+ Focus: Specific sports, teams, or athletes; competitions, tournaments, and leagues.\n",
      "* For 'Business': Economic trends, financial transactions, market fluctuations, and company news primarily focused on commerce and industry.\n",
      "\t+ Focus: Business operations, finance, trade, and market performance; mergers, acquisitions, and IPOs.\n",
      "* For 'Sci/Tech': Scientific discoveries, technological advancements, and innovative developments primarily focused on research, development, and innovation.\n",

      "Analysis of Samples:\n",
      "Based on the provided samples, I've derived general principles for classifying news articles into categories 'World', 'Sports', 'Business', or 'Sci/Tech'. Here are the guidelines:\n",
      "\n",
      "**General Characteristics:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **'World':**\n",
      "\t+ Focuses on global events, international relations, and human experiences\n",
      "\t+ Often involves diplomacy, politics, conflict resolution, and humanitarian crises\n",
      "\t+ Can involve science, technology, and environmental issues with a global impact\n",
      "* **'Sports':**\n",
      "\t+ Centers around athletic competitions, teams, players, and performances\n",
      "\t+ Typically covers news related to specific sports, leagues, or events\n",
      "\t+ May include stories about athlete personal lives, controversies, or achievements\n",
      "* **'Business':**\n",
      "\t+ Concerned with economic trends, market movements, and corporate activities\n",
      "\t+ Often reports on company mergers, acquisitions, and financial performance\n",
      "\t+ Can cover entrepreneurship, innovation, and industry-specific developments\n",
      "* **'Sci/Tech':**\n",
      "\t+ Focuses on scientific discoveries, technological advancements, and innovations\n",
      "\t+ Typically covers news related to research, development, and applications\n",
      "\t+ May include stories about breakthroughs, patents, and industry trends\n",
      "\n",
      "**Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Be cautious when categorizing articles that blend multiple topics (e.g., a sports story with scientific implications). Consider the primary focus or angle of the article.\n",
      "* Don't assume an article's category solely based on its title. Read the text and identify the main themes or topics discussed.\n",
      "* Avoid misclassifying an article as 'World' simply because it mentions global events or international relations without providing specific context or impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Guidelines for Prediction:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Read the text:** Understand the article's primary focus, tone, and content.\n",
      "2. **Identify key themes:** Determine the main topics discussed in the article.\n",
      "3. **Consider the language and terminology:** Note the use of technical jargon, scientific concepts, or industry-specific terms that may indicate a specific category.\n",
      "4. **Evaluate the context:** Consider the global, national, or local implications of the story and its potential impact on readers.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these guidelines, you can accurately predict the category of a news article based on its content without additional context.\n",
      "Optimized Prompt:\n",
      "Classify a news article as 'World', 'Sports', 'Business', or 'Sci/Tech' based on its text content. \n",
      "\n",
      "Predict accurately without additional context, considering the following comprehensive criteria:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Is the article primarily focused on global events, international relations, and human experiences?\n",
      "\t* If yes, categorize as 'World'. \n",
      "2. Does the article center around athletic competitions, teams, players, and performances? \n",
      "\t* If yes, categorize as 'Sports'. \n",
      "3. Are economic trends, market movements, or corporate activities the main topics discussed? \n",
      "\t* If yes, categorize as 'Business'.\n",
      "4. Is the article primarily focused on scientific discoveries, technological advancements, or innovations?\n",
