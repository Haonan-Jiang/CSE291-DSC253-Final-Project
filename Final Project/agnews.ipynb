      "Generated Samples:\n",
      "Here are five news article samples with varying levels of complexity and challenge:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sample 1:**\n",
      "Title: \"Record-Breaking Heat Wave Hits Europe\"\n",
      "Text: A severe heat wave has swept across Europe, breaking temperature records and causing widespread disruptions. The extreme weather has led to power outages, wildfires, and health concerns.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Classification:** 'World' (likely correct)\n",
      "\n",
      "This sample is straightforward, as the article discusses a global weather event that affects multiple countries. It's a clear candidate for the 'World' category.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sample 2:**\n",
      "Title: \"NBA Star Injured in Car Accident; Team Rallies Behind Him\"\n",
      "Text: Professional basketball player James Johnson was involved in a serious car accident, leaving him with severe injuries. His teammates have rallied around him, and his fans are sending well-wishes for his recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Classification:** 'Sports' (likely correct)\n",
      "\n",
      "This sample is also straightforward, as it's an article about a sports-related incident that involves a specific athlete and team. It's a clear candidate for the 'Sports' category.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sample 3:**\n",
      "Title: \"New Study Reveals Surprising Link Between Sleep Patterns and Financial Success\"\n",
      "Text: Researchers have discovered a correlation between sleep patterns and financial success, with those who get adequate rest performing better in their careers and personal lives. The study's findings could have significant implications for professionals looking to improve their productivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Classification:** 'Sci/Tech' (likely correct)\n",
      "\n",
      "This sample is challenging because it requires understanding the scientific methodology behind the study and recognizing its relevance to the broader field of science and technology. It's a clear candidate for the 'Sci/Tech' category.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sample 4:**\n",
      "Title: \"Global Economic Slowdown Feared as Trade Tensions Escalate\"\n",
      "Text: The ongoing trade tensions between major world powers have sparked concerns about a global economic slowdown, with experts warning of potential consequences for international markets and businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Classification:** 'Business' (likely correct)\n",
      "\n",
      "This sample is challenging because it requires understanding the complex economic implications of international trade policies. It's a clear candidate for the 'Business' category.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sample 5:**\n",
      "Title: \"Renowned Environmentalist Dies in Mysterious Circumstances; Investigation Launched\"\n",
      "Text: Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a prominent environmental activist and scientist, was found dead under suspicious circumstances. Authorities have launched an investigation to determine the cause of her death, sparking concerns about potential connections to her work.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Classification:** 'World' or 'Sci/Tech' (unclear)\n",
      "\n",
      "This sample is challenging because it requires understanding the context surrounding Dr. Rodriguez's life and work, as well as recognizing the potential implications for environmental activism and scientific research. While it could be classified under either 'World' or 'Sci/Tech', a more nuanced analysis would be required to determine the correct category.\n",
      "\n",
      "These samples cover a range of scenarios, from straightforward news articles about weather events and sports injuries to more complex stories that require understanding of economic trends, scientific methodologies, and environmental activism.\n",
      "Analysis of Samples:\n",
      "**Procedure for Predicting News Article Categories**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Initial Screening**: Start by scanning the title and a few sentences of the article to identify obvious keywords that could indicate the category.\n",
      "2. **Contextual Analysis**: Read the entire article, paying attention to the content, tone, and language used. Look for indicators such as:\n",
      "\t* Geographic scope: If the article discusses events or issues affecting multiple countries or regions, it's likely 'World'.\n",
      "\t* Sports terminology: The presence of sports-specific terms, teams, or athletes suggests 'Sports'.\n",
      "\t* Financial or economic concepts: Discussion of market trends, trade policies, or business practices points to 'Business'.\n",
      "\t* Scientific jargon or methodology: The use of technical terms, research methods, or data analysis implies 'Sci/Tech'.\n",
      "3. **Contextual Cues**: Identify contextual cues that can help disambiguate the category:\n",
      "\t* If the article mentions international organizations (e.g., United Nations), it's likely 'World'.\n",
      "\t* The presence of specific industries (e.g., tech, healthcare) or companies suggests 'Business' or 'Sci/Tech'.\n",
      "\t* Athlete or team names in conjunction with sports terminology confirms 'Sports'.\n",
      "4. **Error Identification**: For incorrectly classified samples:\n",
      "\t* If an article is misclassified as 'World', it may be due to a lack of attention to the specific geographic scope (e.g., Sample 2, \"NBA Star Injured...\").\n",
      "\t* Incorrect classification as 'Sports' might occur if the article discusses sports-related issues but lacks explicit sports terminology (e.g., Sample 3, \"New Study Reveals...\").\n",
      "\t* Misclassification as 'Business' could result from neglecting to consider the scientific or environmental implications of the article's content (e.g., Sample 5, \"Renowned Environmentalist Dies...\".\n",
      "5. **Categorization**: Based on the analysis, assign each sample to one of the four categories: 'World', 'Sports', 'Business', or 'Sci/Tech'.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Characteristics**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Correctly classified samples typically exhibit clear indicators of their respective categories (e.g., sports terminology in Sample 2).\n",
      "* Incorrectly classified samples often lack these indicators or contain ambiguous language that can be interpreted differently (e.g., Sample 5, which could be categorized as either 'World' or 'Sci/Tech').\n",
      "\n",
      "**Circumstances for Predicting Each Label**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **'World'**: Articles discussing international events, organizations, or issues affecting multiple countries.\n",
      "* **'Sports'**: Articles featuring sports-related incidents, teams, or athletes, with explicit sports terminology.\n",
      "* **'Business'**: Articles focused on economic trends, trade policies, or specific industries, with language indicating financial or commercial implications.\n",
      "* **'Sci/Tech'**: Articles discussing scientific research, technological advancements, or environmental issues, with technical terms and methodology.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following this procedure and considering the key characteristics and circumstances for each label, you can improve your ability to predict the category of a given news article.\n",
      "Optimized Prompt:\n",
      "Here is an optimized prompt for predicting whether a news article is 'World', 'Sports', 'Business', or 'Sci/Tech':\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Predict the category of this news article based on its title, content, and tone. Consider the following criteria:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Is the article discussing international events, organizations, or issues affecting multiple countries? (Label: 'World')\n",
      "* Does the article feature sports-related incidents, teams, or athletes with explicit sports terminology? (Label: 'Sports')\n",
      "* Is the article focused on economic trends, trade policies, or specific industries, with language indicating financial or commercial implications? (Label: 'Business')\n",
      "* Does the article discuss scientific research, technological advancements, or environmental issues, with technical terms and methodology? (Label: 'Sci/Tech')\n",
