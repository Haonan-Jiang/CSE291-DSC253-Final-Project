      "Here are five samples that meet the requirements:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sample 1:**\n",
      "Restaurant Name: Fusion Station\n",
      "Customer Review: \"The menu is a mix of Korean BBQ and American comfort food. I had the bulgogi beef sliders with kimchi slaw, and it was amazing! The atmosphere is modern and lively.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Challenge:** This sample combines Asian fusion elements (Korean BBQ) with American comfort food, making it challenging to categorize based solely on the name.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sample 2:**\n",
      "Restaurant Name: Bella Vita\n",
      "Customer Review: \"This cozy Italian place serves up authentic pasta dishes like nonna used to make. The fettuccine Alfredo is creamy and rich.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Challenge:** The name suggests Mediterranean or Italian cuisine, but the customer review focuses specifically on traditional Italian food, making it unclear which category best fits.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sample 3:**\n",
      "Restaurant Name: Tamarindo\n",
      "Customer Review: \"I tried the chiles rellenos with roasted vegetables, and it was love at first bite. The patio has a great view of the city.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Challenge:** The name suggests Mexican cuisine, but the customer review mentions roasted vegetables, which could be a hint towards a fusion or Mediterranean-inspired dish.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sample 4:**\n",
      "Restaurant Name: Jade Garden\n",
      "Customer Review: \"The Szechuan chicken was spicy and savory, served with steamed broccoli. The decor is elegant and modern.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Challenge:** The name suggests Chinese cuisine, but the customer review mentions Szechuan flavors and an elegant atmosphere, which could be a hint towards higher-end or contemporary Asian fusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sample 5:**\n",
      "Restaurant Name: Bannock's\n",
      "Customer Review: \"This Canadian-inspired cafe serves up poutine with Montreal-style smoked meat. The cozy atmosphere is perfect for a cold winter day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Challenge:** The name suggests Canadian cuisine, but the customer review focuses specifically on a popular dish from Quebec (Montreal-style smoked meat), making it unclear whether this restaurant fits into the 'Canadian (New)' category or another category entirely.\n",

      "After analyzing the samples, I've derived general principles for classifying restaurants into the specified categories. Here are the key findings:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Indicators/Characteristics:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **American (Traditional):**\n",
      "\t+ Name containing \"American\" or \"Classic\"\n",
      "\t+ Menu featuring traditional American dishes like burgers, mac 'n cheese, and comfort food\n",
      "\t+ Customer reviews mentioning classic American flavors or nostalgic atmosphere\n",
      "* **American (New):**\n",
      "\t+ Name suggesting modern twists or innovation (e.g., \"Fusion,\" \"Modern,\" \"Fresh\")\n",
      "\t+ Menu showcasing contemporary American cuisine with unique flavor combinations\n",
      "\t+ Customer reviews highlighting creative dishes, bold flavors, and trendy atmosphere\n",
      "* **Mexican:**\n",
      "\t+ Name containing \"Mex\" or \"Taco\"\n",
      "\t+ Menu featuring traditional Mexican dishes like tacos, burritos, and quesadillas\n",
      "\t+ Customer reviews mentioning authentic Mexican flavors, vibrant colors, and lively atmosphere\n",
      "* **Chinese:**\n",
      "\t+ Name suggesting Chinese cuisine (e.g., \"Jade,\" \"Wok\")\n",
      "\t+ Menu featuring traditional Chinese dishes like stir-fries, noodles, and dim sum\n",
      "\t+ Customer reviews highlighting wok-fried foods, delicate sauces, and ornate decor\n",
      "* **Mediterranean:**\n",
      "\t+ Name containing \"Med\" or \"Olive\"\n",
      "\t+ Menu featuring Mediterranean-inspired dishes with olive oil, lemon, and herbs\n",
      "\t+ Customer reviews mentioning fresh flavors, rustic atmosphere, and warm hospitality\n",
      "* **Italian:**\n",
      "\t+ Name suggesting Italian cuisine (e.g., \"Bella Vita,\" \"Pasta\")\n",
      "\t+ Menu featuring traditional Italian dishes like pasta, pizza, and risotto\n",
      "\t+ Customer reviews highlighting rich flavors, cozy atmosphere, and classic Italian charm\n",
      "* **Thai:**\n",
      "\t+ Name containing \"Thai\" or \"Bangkok\"\n",
      "\t+ Menu featuring authentic Thai dishes like pad thai, tom yum soup, and green curry\n",
      "\t+ Customer reviews mentioning spicy flavors, vibrant colors, and bustling atmosphere\n",
      "* **Asian Fusion:**\n",
      "\t+ Name suggesting fusion cuisine (e.g., \"Fusion Station\")\n",
      "\t+ Menu blending Asian flavors with Western or international twists\n",
      "\t+ Customer reviews highlighting creative combinations of East meets West\n",
      "* **Canadian (New):**\n",
      "\t+ Name suggesting modern Canadian cuisine (e.g., \"Bannock's\")\n",
      "\t+ Menu featuring contemporary Canadian dishes with fresh, local ingredients\n",
      "\t+ Customer reviews mentioning innovative flavors, cozy atmosphere, and pride in Canadian heritage\n",
      "* **Japanese:**\n",
      "\t+ Name containing \"Japan\" or \"Sushi\"\n",
      "\t+ Menu featuring traditional Japanese dishes like sushi, ramen, and tempura\n",
      "\t+ Customer reviews highlighting delicate flavors, serene atmosphere, and respect for Japanese culture\n",
      "\n",
      "**Common Pitfalls and Strategies:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Be cautious of names that seem generic (e.g., \"Food\" or \"Grill\") without considering the menu or customer reviews.\n",
      "* Avoid misclassifying based on a single characteristic; consider multiple indicators and patterns.\n",
      "* Don't rely solely on customer reviews; analyze the name, menu, and overall atmosphere to make an informed decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Criteria/Rules:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Name-based classification:** If the name strongly suggests a specific cuisine (e.g., \"Tamarindo\" for Mexican), prioritize that classification.\n",
      "2. **Menu-driven analysis:** If the menu is diverse or features unique flavor combinations, consider Asian Fusion or American (New) categories.\n",
      "3. **Customer review insights:** Pay attention to customer reviews highlighting cultural authenticity, traditional flavors, or modern twists; these can influence the final classification.\n",
      "4. **Atmosphere and decor:** Analyze the restaurant's atmosphere and decor to further support or contradict the initial classification.\n",
      "\n",
      "By considering these key indicators, common pitfalls, and criteria, you'll be better equipped to accurately predict the type of cuisine a restaurant serves based on its name and customer reviews.\n",

      "Here are 5 sample restaurant name and review combinations that cover a diverse range of scenarios:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sample 1:**\n",
      "Restaurant Name: Saffron Kitchen\n",
      "Customer Review: \"Loved the unique fusion of Indian and Mediterranean flavors! The lamb shawarma was to die for.\"\n",
      "Prediction Challenge: Will this restaurant be correctly classified as 'Mediterranean' or 'Asian Fusion', considering the mention of Indian flavors?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sample 2:**\n",
      "Restaurant Name: Burger Barn\n",
      "Customer Review: \"Best veggie burger I've ever had! The sweet potato fries were a game-changer too.\"\n",
      "Prediction Challenge: This classic-sounding name might lead one to predict an 'American (Traditional)' restaurant, but will the mention of sweet potato fries tip the scales towards 'Canadian (New)' or something else?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sample 3:**\n",
      "Restaurant Name: Tokyo Tacos\n",
      "Customer Review: \"Craving authentic Japanese-Mexican fusion? Look no further! Their spicy tuna tacos are addictive.\"\n",
      "Prediction Challenge: With a name like Tokyo Tacos, one might expect a straightforward 'Japanese' classification. But will the mention of Mexican fusion and spicy tuna tacos lead to an alternative classification, such as 'Asian Fusion' or 'Thai'?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sample 4:**\n",
      "Restaurant Name: La Bella Vita\n",
      "Customer Review: \"This cozy Italian restaurant served the best homemade pasta I've ever had. The tiramisu was heavenly too!\"\n",
      "Prediction Challenge: Will this seemingly traditional Italian name and review lead to a correct classification as 'Italian', or might the mention of homemade pasta and tiramisu hint at an alternative, such as 'Mediterranean'?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sample 5:**\n",
      "Restaurant Name: Fusion Station\n",
      "Customer Review: \"This innovative spot combines flavors from China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. The kimchi fried rice was a highlight!\"\n",
      "Prediction Challenge: With a name like Fusion Station, one might expect an 'Asian Fusion' classification. But will the mention of specific countries and dishes (e.g., China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam) lead to a more nuanced classification, such as 'Chinese', 'Japanese', or something else entirely?\n",
      "\n",
      "These samples aim to cover a range of challenges, from naming conventions to linguistic cues, to keep you on your toes while predicting the type restaurant!\n",
      "Analysis of Restaurant Classification Guidelines:\n",
      "After analyzing the provided samples, I've derived general principles for classifying restaurants into the specified categories. Here are the key findings:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Indicators/Characteristics:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **'American (Traditional)':**\n",
      "\t* Name often includes \"Barn\", \"Diner\", or \"Inn\".\n",
      "\t* Review mentions classic American dishes like burgers, fries, and milkshakes.\n",
      "\t* May feature nostalgic or retro themes.\n",
      "2. **'American (New)':**\n",
      "\t* Name might include \"Fusion\" or \"Modern\" to indicate a blend of cuisines.\n",
      "\t* Reviews highlight innovative twists on traditional American fare, such as gourmet burgers or creative sandwiches.\n",
      "\t* Emphasizes freshness, locally sourced ingredients, and unique presentation.\n",
      "3. **'Mexican':**\n",
      "\t* Name typically includes \"Tacos\", \"Mesa\", \"Rancho\", or \"Fiesta\".\n",
      "\t* Reviews mention popular Mexican dishes like tacos, burritos, or enchiladas.\n",
      "\t* Often features vibrant, colorful themes and decorations inspired by Latin American culture.\n",
      "4. **'Chinese':**\n",
      "\t* Name often includes \"Wok\", \"Chow Mein\", \"Mandarin\", or \"Peking\".\n",
      "\t* Reviews highlight traditional Chinese dishes like wonton soup, lo mein, or Kung Pao chicken.\n",
      "\t* May feature ornate decorations, pagodas, or other Asian-inspired elements.\n",
      "5. **'Mediterranean':**\n",
      "\t* Name might include \"Olive\", \"Grape\", \"Feta\", or \"Bazaar\".\n",
      "\t* Reviews emphasize Mediterranean cuisine's focus on fresh vegetables, herbs, and seafood.\n",
      "\t* Often features warm, inviting colors and decorations inspired by the region's cultures (e.g., Greek, Turkish).\n",
      "6. **'Italian':**\n",
      "\t* Name typically includes \"Pizzeria\", \"Trattoria\", or \"Café\" to indicate Italian heritage.\n",
      "\t* Reviews highlight traditional Italian dishes like pasta, pizza, or risotto.\n",
      "\t* May feature rustic, vintage-inspired decorations and a cozy atmosphere.\n",
      "7. **'Thai':**\n",
      "\t* Name often includes \"Thai\", \"Siam\", or \"Bangkok\".\n",
      "\t* Reviews mention popular Thai dishes like pad thai, green curry, or tom yum soup.\n",
      "\t* Frequently features bold, colorful decorations inspired by Thai culture (e.g., temples, elephants).\n",
      "8. **'Asian Fusion':**\n",
      "\t* Name might include \"Fusion\", \"Mashup\", or \"East Meets West\".\n",
      "\t* Reviews highlight innovative blends of Asian cuisines, such as Korean-Mexican fusion.\n",
      "\t* Often features modern, sleek decorations and a focus on unique flavor combinations.\n",
      "9. **'Canadian (New)':**\n",
      "\t* Name typically includes \"North\", \"Maple\", or \"Poutine\" to indicate Canadian influences.\n",
      "\t* Reviews emphasize fresh, locally sourced ingredients and creative twists on classic Canadian dishes like poutine or Montreal-style bagels.\n",
      "10. **'Japanese':**\n",
      "\t* Name often includes \"Tokyo\", \"Sushi\", or \"Ramen\".\n",
      "\t* Reviews highlight traditional Japanese cuisine's focus on sushi, ramen, or tempura.\n",
      "\t* May feature minimalist, modern decorations inspired by Japanese culture (e.g., cherry blossoms).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Common Pitfalls and Strategies:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Be wary of names that only include a cuisine's name without indicating the type of restaurant**: For example, \"Thai Restaurant\" might not be immediately classified as 'Thai'.\n",
      "2. **Don't rely solely on specific dishes mentioned in reviews**: While dishes can be indicative, they may not be universally characteristic of the cuisine.\n",
      "3. **Consider the tone and language used in reviews**: Reviews that emphasize freshness, local ingredients, or innovative twists might suggest a more modern or fusion-oriented approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Criteria/Rules for Prediction:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **If the name includes words like \"Tacos\", \"Mesa\", or \"Rancho\", predict 'Mexican'.\n",
      "2. **If the name features \"Wok\" or \"Chow Mein\", predict 'Chinese'.\n",
      "3. **If the name mentions \"Pizzeria\", \"Trattoria\", or \"Café\" and reviews highlight pasta, pizza, or risotto, predict 'Italian'.\n",
      "4. **If the name includes \"Fusion\", \"Mashup\", or \"East Meets West\", predict 'Asian Fusion' or a related cuisine (e.g., Korean-Mexican).\n",
      "5. **If the name features \"North\", \"Maple\", or \"Poutine\" and reviews emphasize locally sourced ingredients, predict 'Canadian (New)'.\n",
      "6. **If the name includes \"Tokyo\", \"Sushi\", or \"Ramen\" and reviews highlight traditional Japanese cuisine, predict 'Japanese'.\n",
      "\n",
      "By considering these key indicators, common pitfalls, and criteria, you can develop a systematic approach to predicting the type of restaurant based on its name and customer reviews.\n",
      "Optimized Prompt:\n",
      "Predict the type of restaurant based on its name and customer reviews. Given a restaurant name and review, classify it into one of the following categories:\n",
      "\n",
      "* 'American (Traditional)'\n",
      "* 'American (New)'\n",
      "* 'Mexican'\n",
      "* 'Chinese'\n",
      "* 'Mediterranean'\n",
      "* 'Italian'\n",
      "* 'Thai'\n",
      "* 'Asian Fusion'\n",
      "* 'Canadian (New)'\n",
      "* 'Japanese'\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider the following criteria to make your prediction:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. If the name includes words like \"Tacos\", \"Mesa\", or \"Rancho\", predict 'Mexican'.\n",
      "2. If the name features \"Wok\" or \"Chow Mein\", predict 'Chinese'.\n",
      "3. If the name mentions \"Pizzeria\", \"Trattoria\", or \"Café\" and reviews highlight pasta, pizza, or risotto, predict 'Italian'.\n",
      "4. If the name includes \"Fusion\", \"Mashup\", or \"East Meets West\", predict 'Asian Fusion' or a related cuisine (e.g., Korean-Mexican).\n",
      "5. If the name features \"North\", \"Maple\", or \"Poutine\" and reviews emphasize locally sourced ingredients, predict 'Canadian (New)'.\n",
      "6. If the name includes \"Tokyo\", \"Sushi\", or \"Ramen\" and reviews highlight traditional Japanese cuisine, predict 'Japanese'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be cautious of names that only include a cuisine's name without indicating the type of restaurant. Avoid relying solely on specific dishes mentioned in reviews. Instead, consider the tone and language used in reviews to inform your prediction.\n",
