      "Generated Samples:\n",
      "Here are five samples that meet the requirements:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sample 1:**\n",
      "Restaurant Name: Fusion Station\n",
      "Customer Review: \"The menu is a mix of Korean BBQ and American comfort food. I had the bulgogi beef sliders with kimchi slaw, and it was amazing! The atmosphere is modern and lively.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Challenge:** This sample combines Asian fusion elements (Korean BBQ) with American comfort food, making it challenging to categorize based solely on the name.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sample 2:**\n",
      "Restaurant Name: Bella Vita\n",
      "Customer Review: \"This cozy Italian place serves up authentic pasta dishes like nonna used to make. The fettuccine Alfredo is creamy and rich.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Challenge:** The name suggests Mediterranean or Italian cuisine, but the customer review focuses specifically on traditional Italian food, making it unclear which category best fits.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sample 3:**\n",
      "Restaurant Name: Tamarindo\n",
      "Customer Review: \"I tried the chiles rellenos with roasted vegetables, and it was love at first bite. The patio has a great view of the city.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Challenge:** The name suggests Mexican cuisine, but the customer review mentions roasted vegetables, which could be a hint towards a fusion or Mediterranean-inspired dish.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sample 4:**\n",
      "Restaurant Name: Jade Garden\n",
      "Customer Review: \"The Szechuan chicken was spicy and savory, served with steamed broccoli. The decor is elegant and modern.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Challenge:** The name suggests Chinese cuisine, but the customer review mentions Szechuan flavors and an elegant atmosphere, which could be a hint towards higher-end or contemporary Asian fusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sample 5:**\n",
      "Restaurant Name: Bannock's\n",
      "Customer Review: \"This Canadian-inspired cafe serves up poutine with Montreal-style smoked meat. The cozy atmosphere is perfect for a cold winter day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Challenge:** The name suggests Canadian cuisine, but the customer review focuses specifically on a popular dish from Quebec (Montreal-style smoked meat), making it unclear whether this restaurant fits into the 'Canadian (New)' category or another category entirely.\n",

      "These samples aim to present unique and intricate challenges that require careful consideration of both the restaurant name and the customer review to make an accurate classification.\n",
      "Analysis of Restaurant Classification Guidelines:\n",
      "After analyzing the samples, I've derived general principles for classifying restaurants into the specified categories. Here are the key findings:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Indicators/Characteristics:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **American (Traditional):**\n",
      "\t+ Name containing \"American\" or \"Classic\"\n",
      "\t+ Menu featuring traditional American dishes like burgers, mac 'n cheese, and comfort food\n",
      "\t+ Customer reviews mentioning classic American flavors or nostalgic atmosphere\n",
      "* **American (New):**\n",
      "\t+ Name suggesting modern twists or innovation (e.g., \"Fusion,\" \"Modern,\" \"Fresh\")\n",
      "\t+ Menu showcasing contemporary American cuisine with unique flavor combinations\n",
      "\t+ Customer reviews highlighting creative dishes, bold flavors, and trendy atmosphere\n",
      "* **Mexican:**\n",
      "\t+ Name containing \"Mex\" or \"Taco\"\n",
      "\t+ Menu featuring traditional Mexican dishes like tacos, burritos, and quesadillas\n",
      "\t+ Customer reviews mentioning authentic Mexican flavors, vibrant colors, and lively atmosphere\n",
      "* **Chinese:**\n",
      "\t+ Name suggesting Chinese cuisine (e.g., \"Jade,\" \"Wok\")\n",
      "\t+ Menu featuring traditional Chinese dishes like stir-fries, noodles, and dim sum\n",
      "\t+ Customer reviews highlighting wok-fried foods, delicate sauces, and ornate decor\n",
      "* **Mediterranean:**\n",
      "\t+ Name containing \"Med\" or \"Olive\"\n",
      "\t+ Menu featuring Mediterranean-inspired dishes with olive oil, lemon, and herbs\n",
      "\t+ Customer reviews mentioning fresh flavors, rustic atmosphere, and warm hospitality\n",
      "* **Italian:**\n",
      "\t+ Name suggesting Italian cuisine (e.g., \"Bella Vita,\" \"Pasta\")\n",
      "\t+ Menu featuring traditional Italian dishes like pasta, pizza, and risotto\n",
      "\t+ Customer reviews highlighting rich flavors, cozy atmosphere, and classic Italian charm\n",
      "* **Thai:**\n",
      "\t+ Name containing \"Thai\" or \"Bangkok\"\n",
      "\t+ Menu featuring authentic Thai dishes like pad thai, tom yum soup, and green curry\n",
      "\t+ Customer reviews mentioning spicy flavors, vibrant colors, and bustling atmosphere\n",
      "* **Asian Fusion:**\n",
      "\t+ Name suggesting fusion cuisine (e.g., \"Fusion Station\")\n",
      "\t+ Menu blending Asian flavors with Western or international twists\n",
      "\t+ Customer reviews highlighting creative combinations of East meets West\n",
      "* **Canadian (New):**\n",
      "\t+ Name suggesting modern Canadian cuisine (e.g., \"Bannock's\")\n",
      "\t+ Menu featuring contemporary Canadian dishes with fresh, local ingredients\n",
      "\t+ Customer reviews mentioning innovative flavors, cozy atmosphere, and pride in Canadian heritage\n",
      "* **Japanese:**\n",
      "\t+ Name containing \"Japan\" or \"Sushi\"\n",
      "\t+ Menu featuring traditional Japanese dishes like sushi, ramen, and tempura\n",
      "\t+ Customer reviews highlighting delicate flavors, serene atmosphere, and respect for Japanese culture\n",
      "\n",
      "**Common Pitfalls and Strategies:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Be cautious of names that seem generic (e.g., \"Food\" or \"Grill\") without considering the menu or customer reviews.\n",
      "* Avoid misclassifying based on a single characteristic; consider multiple indicators and patterns.\n",
      "* Don't rely solely on customer reviews; analyze the name, menu, and overall atmosphere to make an informed decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Criteria/Rules:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Name-based classification:** If the name strongly suggests a specific cuisine (e.g., \"Tamarindo\" for Mexican), prioritize that classification.\n",
      "2. **Menu-driven analysis:** If the menu is diverse or features unique flavor combinations, consider Asian Fusion or American (New) categories.\n",
      "3. **Customer review insights:** Pay attention to customer reviews highlighting cultural authenticity, traditional flavors, or modern twists; these can influence the final classification.\n",
      "4. **Atmosphere and decor:** Analyze the restaurant's atmosphere and decor to further support or contradict the initial classification.\n",
      "\n",
      "By considering these key indicators, common pitfalls, and criteria, you'll be better equipped to accurately predict the type of cuisine a restaurant serves based on its name and customer reviews.\n",
